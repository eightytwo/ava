# Audio Visual Arcade

A web site for the sharing and critiquing of diaporamas.

## Features

Audio Visual Arcade makes it incredibly easy for members of photography or audio visual clubs to share their audio visuals with one another. The traditional structure of folios and rounds are adhered to, along with the ability for members to critique eachothers audio visuals.

### Organisation

An organisation is a top level construct to which members and folios belong.

### Folio

An organisation is split into folios. You might have a folio purely for beginners where only general commenting is allowed. You may also have a folio for competitions where full critiquing is enabled, along with general comments.

### Round

A folio is split into rounds, which have a start and end date. Members of the folio can upload audio visuals during these dates.

### Audio Visual

An audio visual (or diaporama) is a photographic slideshow with accompanying audio/music.

## Technology

The initial version of Audio Visual Arcade was created using Python and the Google App Engine. The second (and current) version was rewritten using Ruby on Rails.
